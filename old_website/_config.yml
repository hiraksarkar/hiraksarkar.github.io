  - image: "/img/back_img_net.jpg"
    date: "June 2018 - Aug 2018"
    description: "I worked on three different problems at Facebook, Menlo Park, ranging from optimizing scalable data pipelines to using transfer learning to 
    satellite images. I gained expertise in large scale query optimization, spatial clustering and deep learning based image classification techniques"


  - image: "/img/back_img_net.jpg"
    date: "June 2017 - Present"
    description: "Beside working on a cool data structures for [*pufferfish*](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish), de-Bruijn graph
based mappers, I got really interested in publicly available big data. With Rob, I am now figuring out this maze of
[Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), and trying to find meaningful insights from this exponentially increasing public database.
Keep checking for exciting upcoming news. Released [[biorXiv]](https://doi.org/10.1101/191874)."


  - image: "/img/back_img_net.jpg"
    date: "March 2017 - May 2017"
    description: "We worked on a new way for solving the abundance calculation problem for RNA-seq read mapping.
    Kallisto and RapMap are not as accurate as you think in special cases, such as discussed
    [here](https://cgatoxford.wordpress.com/2016/08/17/why-you-should-stop-using-featurecounts-htseq-or-cufflinks2-and-start-using-kallisto-salmon-or-sailfish/).
    We propose Selective Alignment. Preprinted [[biorXiv]](https://doi.org/10.1101/138800)."

  - image: "/img/back_img_net.jpg"
    date: "Oct 2016 - Feb 2017"
    description: "We worked on RNA-seq compression algorithm. Developed a state-of-the-art RNA-seq compression tool,
    introducing the idea of semi-reference based compression, now published in [*Bioinformatics*](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx428) now. I also worked on a poster
    with [Prof Siepel](http://siepellab.labsites.cshl.edu/), presented in [*BioData*](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=DATA&year=16)."

  - image: "/img/back_img_net.jpg"
    date: "May 2016 - July 2016"
    description: "I collaborated with [Prof. Adam Siepel](http://siepellab.labsites.cshl.edu/). Learned a lot about probabilistic
    graphical model. Developed a model for incorporating information from GRO-seq data and RNA-seq data.
    Such multimodal analysis has not been explored before."

  - image: "/img/back_img_net.jpg"
    date: "May 2016"
    description: "Yayy, I passed my Research Proficiency Examination [[slides]](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hiraksarkar/hiraksarkar.github.io/master/data/RPE_slides.pdf). Honored to have [*Prof Mike Schatz*](http://schatz-lab.org/)(JHU),
    [*Prof Adam Siepel*](http://siepellab.labsites.cshl.edu/)(CSHL) and my supervisor Prof. Robert Patro on my committee."

    date: "May 2015 - May 2016"
    description: "I started working with [*Prof Robert Patro*](http://www.robpatro.com/redesign/), excited, at the end of almost an year we (with my other labmates) developed two
    tools, [*RapMap*](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap/) and [*RapClust*](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapClust)."
