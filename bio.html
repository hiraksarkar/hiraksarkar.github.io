### Brief Bio

I received my masters degree in Computer Science from Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in 2013. Before  that I completed my bachelors (B.Tech) from Kalyani Govt. Engineering College in 2011, in Computer Science. At ISI, I defended my masters thesis in graph theory under the supervision of Prof. Bhargab Bhattacharyya and Prof. Sandip Das. Before joining Stony Brook, I was a researcher for some time at National University of Singapore. I also worked as a research fellow at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur. 

During a brief period I was a visiting researcher at Indian Statistical Institute, at the same time I served as a guest lecturer at computer science department, Vivekananda University. I had the great fortune to briefly work with Swami Sarvottamanandaji, fondly known as Sreesh Maharaj. During those days, I somehow acquired an *erdos number* of [3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hiraksarkar/hiraksarkar.github.io/master/data/erdos.png), which I am still extremly proud of.
