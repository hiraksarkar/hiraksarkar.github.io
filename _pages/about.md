Hi I am Hirak, a computer science Ph.D student at [University of Maryland](www.cs.umd.edu) In collaboration with my advisor [Rob Patro](http://www.robpatro.com/), I primarily work on two broad areas of computational biology. On one hand, I design ultra fast mapping algorithms and compression schemes for raw sequencing data. On the other hand, I also work on the application of machine learning algorithms to analyze heterogeneous, large-scale public datasets. 

Academic Background
======
Before my research assistantship at UMD, I completed a masters in Computer Science at Stony Brook University and a Masters of Technology at Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta (more focused towards theoretical computer science).  At the Indian Statistical Institute, I defended my masters thesis in graph theory (which gained *erdos number* of [3](images/erdos.png), which is closest I could have gotten to). For a brief stint, I was a researcher at the CS department at National University of Singapore and a junior research fellow at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur.
