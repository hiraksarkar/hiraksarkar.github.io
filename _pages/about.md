<em>I have many institute emails, they change as I move from one institute to another. The constant email id is hiraksarkar.cs@gmail.com</em> 

Hi I am Hirak, a Ludwig Princeton Scholar at the [Princeton University](https://princeton.edu). I work in the field of cancer-genomics under the guidance of Prof. [Yibin Kang](https://molbio.princeton.edu/people/yibin-kang) and Prof. [Ben Raphael](https://lsi.princeton.edu/ben-raphael). I am very fortunate to work with Prof. [Eileen White](https://www.cinj.org/research/eileen-white-phd)'s lab at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey. 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Harvard](https://hms.harvard.edu)  with Prof. [Peter Kharchenko](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/people/peter-kharchenko) (till mid-2022) . I completed my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Maryland](www.cs.umd.edu) under the guidance of Prof. [Rob Patro](http://www.robpatro.com/). I primarily work on two broad areas of computational biology. On one hand, I design ultra fast mapping algorithms and compression schemes for raw sequencing data. On the other hand, I also work on the application of machine learning algorithms to analyze heterogeneous, large-scale public datasets. 


<font color="red"><i> Feel free to schedule a one-to-one zoom meeting with me via [calendarly](https://calendly.com/hs0424) if you are a young researcher and want to discuss research-based career path especially in bioinformatics/computational biology. **Disclaimer** -- I am _neither_ a PI _nor_ can offer paid positions. If I am available for the booked time slot, a confirmation email will be sent.</i></font>
