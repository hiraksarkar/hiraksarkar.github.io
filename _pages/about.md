Hi I am Hirak, a postdoctoral researcher at [Harvard](https://hms.harvard.edu)  with Prof. [Peter Kharchenko](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/people/peter-kharchenko).  I completed my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Maryland](www.cs.umd.edu) under the guidance of Prof. [Rob Patro](http://www.robpatro.com/). I primarily work on two broad areas of computational biology. On one hand, I design ultra fast mapping algorithms and compression schemes for raw sequencing data. On the other hand, I also work on the application of machine learning algorithms to analyze heterogeneous, large-scale public datasets. 

Academic Background
======
Before my research assistantship at UMD, I completed a Masters (M.S.) in Computer Science at Stony Brook University and a Masters of Technology (M.Tech) at Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta (more focused towards theoretical computer science).  At the Indian Statistical Institute, I defended my masters thesis in graph theory (which gained *erdos number* of [3](images/erdos.png), which is closest I could have gotten to). For a brief stint, I was a researcher at the CS department at National University of Singapore and a junior research fellow at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur.
