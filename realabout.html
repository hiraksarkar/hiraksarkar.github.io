### About
I am a computer science Ph.D student at <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/" rel="nofollow">Stony Brook University</a>. In collaboration with my advisor <a href="http://www.robpatro.com/redesign/" rel="nofollow">Rob Patro</a>, I primarily work on two broad areas of computational biology. On one hand, I design ultra fast mapping algorithms and compression schemes for raw sequencing data. On the other hand, I also work on the application of machine learnings algorithm to analyse heterogeneous, large-scale public datasets.
