I will post about my venture into Data Science and Machine Learning here. It mostly includes papers from 
the domain of Bioinformatics and this is my area of Ph.D and I am upadated with the domain. Also unlike 
computer vision which has received a lot of attention from the ML community before, Bioinformatics very 
recently has become a subject of application of different parts of deep learning.
